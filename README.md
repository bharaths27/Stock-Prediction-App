## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

This project uses a decoupled architecture to ensure high performance and reliability.

1.  **Offline Data Worker:** A Python script (`Backend/data_generator`) is used to pre-fetch and process data from the `yfinance` API. It stores the results in a local, file-based data store. This offline process isolates the main application from the unreliability and rate-limiting of the live API.
2.  **FastAPI Backend:** A lightweight Python server whose sole responsibility is to read from the pre-fetched data files and serve them to the frontend via a REST API. It also handles the on-the-fly training and prediction with the Scikit-learn models.
3.  **Next.js Frontend:** A modern, responsive user interface that consumes data from the FastAPI backend and provides interactive data visualizations.

## üöÄ Running Locally

1.  **Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # The app uses pre-cached data in the /data folder.
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
2.  **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
